# Twitter friends' favorites feeds as OPML

This is a quick & dirty PHP page that, given a screen name, will fetch the
friends list for that screen name and generate an OPML reading list of all the
friends' favorites' Atom feeds.  This, then, can be imported into Google Reader
or other feed aggregators.

As of this writing, a demo of this utility is available here:
